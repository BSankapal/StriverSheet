Majority Elements(>N/3 times) | Find the elements that appears more than N/3 times in the array
Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers.
 Find the elements that appear more than N/3 times in the array. 
If no such element exists, return an empty vector.

Optimal Solution - 
keep 2 elements el1, el2, cnt1, cnt2.

if(c1 == 0)
    el1 = arr[i]
    c1 = 1

if(arr[i] == el1)
    c1++

TC - O(N)+O(N)
SC - O(1)
