Find the Majority Element that occurs more than N/2 times
Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers,
Write a program to return an element that occurs more than N/2 times in the given array. 
You may consider that such an element always exists in the array.

Approach 1: 
Brute Force

Approach 2: Better Approach - TO DO - Hashmap
TC - O(n*log n)+O(n)
    Insertion of each element - log n 
SC - O(n)

Approach 3: Optimal Solution
Keep a variable el and cnt - count of element el
For a subarray if cnt = 0 then the el is majority for the subarray 

Keep track of the max occuring element 

if(cnt == 0)
    consider el = arr[i];
    cnt = 1;
if(arr[i] == el)
    cnt++;
else
    cnt--;

TC - O(n) + O(n)
SC - O(1)
