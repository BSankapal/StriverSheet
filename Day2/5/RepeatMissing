Find the repeating and missing numbers
Problem Statement: You are given a read-only array of N integers with values also in the range [1, N] both inclusive. Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers A and B where A repeats twice and B is missing.

Approach 1 : Brute Force
TC - O(N*N)
SC - O(1)

Approach 2 : Hashing - store the occurence
TC - O(N)
SC - O(N)

Approach 3 : Math 
S = sum of all elements
S2 = sum of square of all elements

Sn = n*(n+1)/2
Sn2 = n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6

X-Y = S - Sn = a
X2 - Y2 = S2 - Sn2 = b

int c = b/a
c = X+Y

x = (c+a)/2
y = abs(a-x)

TC - O(N)
SC - O(1)

Approach 4 : Bit
