Merge two Sorted Arrays Without Extra Space
Problem statement: Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of 
sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order.
Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 
so that it contains the last M elements.

Approach 1: 
Step 1:
Keep 2 pointers - i - end of arr1 and j - start of arr2
while(arr1[i] > arr2[j]){
    swap(arr1[i], arr2[j]);
    i--;
    j++;
}

When arr1[i] <= arr2[j] - then the individual subarray will have respective elements but unsorted

Step 2 : sort both arrays

TC - O(min(n, m)) + O(n*logn) + O(m*logm) 
SC - O(1)

Approach 2:
Gap method
