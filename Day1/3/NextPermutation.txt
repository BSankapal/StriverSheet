next_permutation : find next lexicographically greater permutation
Problem Statement: Given an array Arr[] of integers, 
rearrange the numbers of the given array into the 
lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

Approach 1: Subsequence problem -> TLE (Time Limit)

Apporach 2: General Observation and Optimal Soln
Suppose consider the sequence
2 1 5 4 3 0 0 
-> just next element would be - 2 3 0 0 1 4 5

Subarray - right side of the array where arr[i]>arr[i+1] (Decreasing Array)
Pivot/Break Point - where the element just before the subarray starts.
For ex - 1 in the above example

Step 1 : Find Pivot/Break Point

Step 2 : if No pivot -> Decreasing Array(Largest number possible) return reverse of array(Smallest number)

Step 3 : Swap the pivot to the element just greater than pivot present in right
2 [1] 5 4 3 [_] 0 0 => 2 3 5 4 1 0 0 this number is greater than the array

Step 4: rev the array from (pivot index+1) or start of the subarray to last element of the array -> Answer
2 3 0 0 1 4 5

TC - O(3*N)
SC - O(1)
