Set Matrix Zero
Problem Statement: Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 
then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix.

Approach 1:
Brute Force - 
Traverse thru the matrix set the  respective elements(excluding zero) to INT_MIN(-1). 
Next iteration - INT_MIN -> 0;

Time complexity - O(N*M*(N+M)) + O(N*M)
Space complexity - O(1)

Approach 2:
Having a vector to keep track of row and column. 
Mark row and col with 1 if 0 is present in that row;

Time complexity - O(2*N*M)
Space complexity - O(N)+O(M)

Approach 3:
Keeping track of row and col in the 1st row and 1st col of the matrix itself.
col0 -> to keep track whether 0 is present in 1st col

if 0 is present in element matrix[i][j] => Then set matrix[i][0] = 0 and matrix[0][j] = 0; 

Last step - if matrix[0][0] = 0 -> make row1 => 0 and if col1 = 0 -> make col1 => 0.

Time complexity - O(2*N*M)
Space complexity - O(1)
