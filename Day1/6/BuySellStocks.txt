Problem Statement: You are given an array of prices where prices[i] is 
the price of a given stock on an ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and 
choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. 
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Approach 1 : Brute force - TLE(Time limit)
for(int i=0->n){
    for(int j=i+1->n){
        max = maximum diff;
    }
}
return max;

TC - O(N*N)
SC - O(1)

Approach 2 : Optimal Approach
Keep track of 2 elements - minimum ele and maximum profit
if(mini > arr[i])
    mini = arr[i]

if(maxPro < arr[i]-mini)
    maxPro = arr[i]-mini

return maxPro;

TC - O(N)
SC - O(1)
