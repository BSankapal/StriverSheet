Program to generate Pascal’s Triangle
Problem Statement: This problem has 3 variations. They are stated below:
Variation 1: Given row number r and column number c. Print the element at position (r, c) in Pascal’s triangle.
Soln : (r-1)C(c-1)
FOR 0-Based INDEXING

[nCr = n!/r!*(n-r)!]
nC1 = n!/1!*(n-1)!
nC2 = n!/2!*(n-2)!
nCr = temp*(n-r+1)/r

Variation 2: Given the row number n. Print the n-th row of Pascal’s triangle.
n = 5 -> 1 4 6 4 1
temp = 1
temp = 1*(5-1)/1
temp = 4*(5-2)/2

Variation 3: Given the number of rows n. Print the first n rows of Pascal’s triangle.

Approach 1: Brute Force and Optimal Solution
Time Complexity - O(n2)
Space Complexity - O(1)
